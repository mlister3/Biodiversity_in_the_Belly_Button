# Biodiversity_of_the_Belly_Button
## Deployed Dashboard

Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard.

- Following the instructions below in the "Instructions" section, a dashboard was created and deployed that you can use and interact with on this site [https://mlister3.github.io/Biodiversity_of_the_Belly_Button/](https://mlister3.github.io/Biodiversity_of_the_Belly_Button/)

- If you wish to view the HTML, please see the [index.html](index.html) file.

- To see the JavaScript involved with the dashboard, please see the [JS page](AppFiles/static/js).

## Instructions

1. Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json` from the URL `https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json`.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

    - Use `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

    - Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

    - Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.

See below:

3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

    - Use `otu_ids` for the x values.

    - Use `sample_values` for the y values.

    - Use `sample_values` for the marker size.

    - Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

    - Use `otu_labels` for the text values.
